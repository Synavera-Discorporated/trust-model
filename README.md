# The TRUST Model
## Restoring Accountability in the Digital Age

Modern digital systems exercise real power over users, organisations, and societies, yet it is often unclear **who authorised that power**, **who is accountable for its outcomes**, or **how those affected can contest decisions**. Legal compliance and technical performance alone have proven insufficient to resolve this gap.

This repository contains the canonical v1.0 release of the **TRUST model**, a structural framework for restoring accountability in digital systems, alongside **RESPECT**, its companion model for governing interaction and influence in shared environments.

- **TRUST** establishes *directional accountability*: authority must terminate with the user, and systems must be able to report, explain, and justify their actions back to that authority.
- **RESPECT** constrains how systems may affect others, enforcing restrictions on scope, power, and externalised control where multiple users or systems coexist.

Together, TRUST and RESPECT define the minimum structural conditions under which digital systems can be considered legitimately accountable and safe to operate at scale.

This work is **not a technology, product, or compliance checklist**. It is a governance model intended to be applied across domains, including AI systems, platforms, automation, shared services, and public infrastructure.
