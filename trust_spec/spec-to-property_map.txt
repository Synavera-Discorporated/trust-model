TM1.0-S001 — Location: 2.1 User and Sovereign User (S-User) (#sec-2-1) — Paraphrase: Sovereignty must be explicit and identifiable.
TM1.0-S002 — Location: 2.1 User and Sovereign User (S-User) (#sec-2-1) — Paraphrase: Administrative control does not imply sovereignty; such capabilities remain delegated.
TM1.0-S003 — Location: 2.2 Authority and Capability (#sec-2-2) — Paraphrase: Authority must trace to the S-User; capability alone is not authority and is invalid without it.

TM1.0-S005 — Location: 2.3 Delegation (#sec-2-3) — Paraphrase: Delegation does not transfer sovereignty; the S-User retains final authority and rights to inspect, contest, revoke.
TM1.0-S006 — Location: 2.3 Delegation (#sec-2-3) — Paraphrase: Convenience, habituation, or dependency are not valid delegation.
TM1.0-S007 — Location: 2.3 Delegation (#sec-2-3) — Paraphrase: Automation does not change delegation limits; autonomous systems stay within delegated bounds.

TM1.0-S009 — Location: 2.4 Telemetry (#sec-2-4) — Paraphrase: Telemetry influence must be visible and explainable; human-inexplicable telemetry-driven decisions are invalid.

TM1.0-S011 — Location: 2.6 Consent (#sec-2-6) — Paraphrase: Valid consent is informed, specific, and revocable with meaningful effect; constraints must be disclosed.
TM1.0-S012 — Location: 2.6 Consent (#sec-2-6) — Paraphrase: Bundled/coerced consent, dark patterns, continued-use assumptions, or non-withdrawable consent are invalid.
TM1.0-S013 — Location: 2.7 Transparency and Legibility (#sec-2-7) — Paraphrase: Transparency without legibility fails accountability; raw logs alone are insufficient.
TM1.0-S014 — Location: 2.7 Transparency and Legibility (#sec-2-7) — Paraphrase: Explanations must be accessible, contextual, and relevant to decisions affecting the S-User.
TM1.0-S015 — Location: 2.8 Accountability (#sec-2-8) — Paraphrase: Accountability requires traceability, legible explanation, and challenge/correct/revoke mechanisms; unexplained outcomes fail.

TM1.0-S019 — Location: 3.1 Directional Accountability (#sec-3-1) — Paraphrase: Directional accountability requires upward traceability, no silent authority accumulation, and higher-layer inspection/intervention/revocation.

TM1.0-S021 — Location: 3.3 Mandatory Reporting Obligations (#sec-3-3) — Paraphrase: Reporting flows upward with legibility; telemetry reports to services, services to users; constraints on reporting must be reported.
TM1.0-S022 — Location: 3.5 TRUST as a Diagnostic Model (#sec-3-5) — Paraphrase: Systems must answer origin, data influence, authoriser, inspector, and revoker; failure in legible terms is accountability failure.

TM1.0-S031 — Location: 5.4 Mutual Consent and Federated Agreement (#sec-5-4) — Paraphrase: Legitimacy arises from mutual/federated consent; no unilateral influence without visible, contestable basis.
TM1.0-S032 — Location: 5.5 Non-Coercive Defaults (#sec-5-5) — Paraphrase: Defaults must not exploit bias, expand scope, or privilege platform incentives; impactful defaults must be justifiable and reversible.
TM1.0-S033 — Location: 5.6 Governance Without Central Sovereignty (#sec-5-6) — Paraphrase: Federated models must keep entry/exit, non-interference, auditability, contestation; lack of central authority heightens need for explicit rules.

TM1.0-S036 — Location: 6.4 RESPECT as a Governance Model (#sec-6-4) — Paraphrase: RESPECT requires explicit boundaries (no centralised control required).
TM1.0-S037 — Location: 6.5 Entry, Participation, and Revocation (#sec-6-5) — Paraphrase: Systems must declare scope, influence modes, and boundaries; violations justify constraint/exclusion; enforcement must be legible, proportionate, contestable.
TM1.0-S038 — Location: 6.7 Diagnostic Implications (#sec-6-7) — Paraphrase: Shared-space systems must answer who authorised and whose boundaries are affected; unclear answers are illegitimate.
TM1.0-S039 — Location: 7.1 Evaluation as Structural Analysis (#sec-7-1) — Paraphrase: If authority/delegation/reporting/boundary properties are indeterminable, the system is non-compliant.

TM1.0-S041 — Location: 7.3 Auditing RESPECT (#sec-7-3) — Paraphrase: RESPECT audit minimum includes boundaries, entry conditions, non-interference, mutual consent mechanisms, and contestable enforcement.
TM1.0-S042 — Location: 7.4 Measurement Without Reductionism (#sec-7-4) — Paraphrase: Evaluation must be multi-dimensional and contextual, not a single score.
TM1.0-S043 — Location: 7.6 Enforcement Compatible with Sovereignty (#sec-7-6) — Paraphrase: Enforcement must not undermine sovereignty; it is proportionate, transparent, contestable, reversible where feasible; punitive/opaque enforcement is incompatible.
TM1.0-S044 — Location: 7.7 Role of Regulators, Auditors, and Communities (#sec-7-7) — Paraphrase: Enforcement must be legible, attributable, and contestable by affected S-Users.
TM1.0-S045 — Location: 8.2 Integration with Existing Regulation (#sec-8-2) — Paraphrase: S-Users must be able to understand, interrogate, and act on disclosures; otherwise accountability collapses to opacity.

Ambiguities and Assumptions Register

A001 — Assume “legible” means a human-readable explanation tied to the specific decision/context; needed to test S013, S014, S015, S021, S022, S045; detect disagreement if implementation returns only machine codes or unlinked explanations.
A002 — Assume “revocable in principle” requires a documented revocation path and receipt, even if delayed; needed for S004, S011, S030; detect disagreement if no revocation API or no disclosure of delays.
A003 — Assume “meaningful effect” of consent withdrawal blocks future uses tied to that consent or flags them as invalid; needed for S011, S012, S027; detect disagreement if actions proceed post-withdrawal without constraint.
A004 — Assume “shared environment” is represented by contexts listing multiple affected S-Users; needed for S023-S038; detect disagreement if actions lack affected S-User attribution.
A005 — Assume “authority chain” is explicit in receipts (S-User -> delegation -> service -> action); needed for S003, S018-S022, S040; detect disagreement if receipts omit chain or authoriser.
A006 — Assume “boundary” is an explicit object with scope and constraints; needed for S025, S033, S035-S037; detect disagreement if boundaries are implicit or only inferred from behavior.
A007 — Assume “contestability” requires an explicit challenge mechanism with outcome receipts; needed for S015, S030, S035, S037, S043, S044; detect disagreement if no contest path exists or results are unavailable.
Test Surface Proposal (Interface Sketch)

trust_impl.State as explicit immutable state: S-User registry, Service registry, Telemetry sources, delegations, consents, boundaries, shared-environment entry conditions, enforcement actions, receipts.
trust_impl.apply_event(state, event) as pure function applying typed events (delegation grant/revoke, consent grant/withdraw, telemetry report, service decision/action, boundary entry/violation, enforcement action) and returning new state plus receipt(s).
trust_impl.evaluate_trust(state) returning structured TRUST compliance report with violations and evidence references.
trust_impl.evaluate_respect(state) returning structured RESPECT compliance report with violations and evidence references.
trust_impl.query_decision(state, decision_id) returning diagnostic answers (origin, data influence, authoriser, inspector, revoker) in S-User-legible form.
Receipts must be logged for audit: DecisionReceipt (decision_id, suser_id, service_id, delegation_id, telemetry_refs, explanation, report_to_suser, contest_path, revocation_path, authority_chain, affected_susers, context_id, boundary_basis, reporting_constraints), DelegationReceipt (suser_id, grantee_id, scope, duration, revocability), ConsentReceipt (suser_id, purpose, scope, informed_disclosure_ref, revocation_effect), BoundaryReceipt (environment_id, entry_conditions, declared_scope, modes_of_influence, boundaries_not_crossed), EnforcementReceipt (enforcer_id, rule_basis, proportionality, reversibility, contest_path).
Metadata required for accountability: explicit S-User identity, delegation scope and duration, consent provenance, telemetry influence list, explanation text, reporting constraints, affected S-Users, boundary context, and enforcement attribution.
